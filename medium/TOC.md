# SydNay’s Expeditions in the Bitstream Wilderness — TOC

This collection reads like a **guided field journal through modern AI**: each entry introduces a major concept/model family or a “where AI is going” theme, wrapped in an exploratory narrative voice (“Bitstream Wilderness”, “Silicon Rainforest”). It’s designed to be **approachable and map-like** (what it is → why it matters → how it’s used → what to watch out for), rather than code-heavy or benchmark-driven.

## Publication Overview (high-level)

### What this publication is
- **Edutainment + AI orientation**: an accessible “field guide” to AI concepts (LLMs, RL, GANs, knowledge graphs, anomaly detection, etc.).
- **Systems thinking**: entries often frame AI as an ecosystem of interacting capabilities (language, vision, action, collaboration).
- **Practical usage lens**: prompt engineering appears as a key skill for working with modern AI systems.
- **Responsible AI awareness**: a recurring emphasis on ethics, governance, and careful deployment.

### How to use this TOC
If you’re reading sequentially:
1) Start with **Machine Learning Fundamentals**
2) Work through **Core Model Families** (language, vision, action, RL, GANs, graphs, etc.)
3) Then read the **“Rise of AI…”** series for applied trends
4) Finish with **Prompt Engineering** for hands-on collaboration patterns
