# Steamgard Expo of Innovations: Series Bible + Character Profile

## Narrative Recap
- **Conflict:** The Aether-Pulse Oscillator threatens the Aetherium as a forced "Perfect Hum" collides with Steamgard’s natural resonance. 
- **Hero’s Path:** SydNay shifts from detached observer to mediator between Master Thorne’s elite vision and Old Barnaby’s subterranean wisdom. 
- **Breakthrough:** The Barnaby Method (a quarter-turn release) stabilizes the city by letting the system "sigh" instead of fracture. 
- **Worldbuilding:** Steamgard’s brass elegance hides a living, breathing infrastructure where pressure, frequency, and civic ordinances govern survival. 

## Steamgard: The Official Series Bible

### Core Premise
Steamgard is a steampunk metropolis powered by steam resonance and civic ritual. Its prosperity depends on maintaining harmony between innovation and the city’s natural acoustic rhythms.

### Geography & Landmarks
- **The Aetherium:** A grand iron-and-glass dome that hosts the elite and the Expo of Innovations.
- **Sub-Sector 9 Steam-Tunnels:** The industrial underbelly where pressure and maintenance expertise keep the city alive.
- **The Expo of Innovations:** Steamgard’s annual showcase of new mechanisms, inventions, and cultural prestige.

### Laws of Physics & Mechanics
- Steam systems operate on resonance; structural integrity depends on the city’s ability to vent pressure safely.
- The Barnaby Method treats pressure as a living pulse rather than a fixed number.
- **Acoustic Impedance:** [Placeholder for formal acoustic-impedance model and equations.]

## Character Profile: SydNay

**Title:** Lead Documentarian & Observer

**Archetype:** The Explorer-Diplomat

| Attribute | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Visuals** | Mid-30s, short wavy chestnut hair, eyes like a "summer sky" (blue). |
| **Demeanor** | A balance of **Gentle Authority** and **Relentless Determination**. |
| **Signature Item** | A soot-stained **Sub-Sector 9 Tuning Key**. |
| **Key Arc** | Moving from an observer of "Clear Skies" to a master of the subterranean "Sigh." |

**Core Motivation:** To document the truth of a world beyond its polished brass surfaces. She acts as the bridge between the academic elite (Master Thorne) and the working-class keepers (Old Barnaby).

## Technology Lexicon
- **Pedal-Driven Gyrocopters:** Light personal transit used to navigate the verticality of the city without polluting the "Clear Sky." 
- **Aether-Pulse Oscillator:** A high-level innovation designed to synchronize city-wide steam systems; volatile if not properly dampened. 
- **Sigh-Valves:** Post-Resonance Incident retrofits that allow buildings to vent harmonic pressure safely.

## Narrative Arc Steps
1. **Inciting Incident:** Master Thorne attempts to force a "Perfect Hum" that ignores the dome’s natural frequency.
2. **Crisis:** A resonance cascade threatens to shatter the Aetherium.
3. **Climax:** SydNay applies the Barnaby Method, releasing pressure through a precise quarter-turn.
4. **Resolution:** Steamgard legalizes "sigh" safety via Ordinance 882-B.

## Creator’s Note
Steamgard is a city built on exquisite precision, but its survival depends on a willingness to breathe. SydNay’s role is to observe, mediate, and keep the narrative pulse steady as the world expands.
