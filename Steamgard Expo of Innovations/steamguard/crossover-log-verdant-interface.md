## Fractal-Leaf Panther Description
The Fractal-Leaf Panther emerged from the condenser mists as a layered silhouette, its coat tessellated with leaflike facets that refracted light into green-gold prisms. Each movement unfurled new spirals along its flank, as if the creature was growing and shedding a living fern lattice in real time. The air around it smelled of sap and ozone, and its gaze held a patient, predatory curiosity.

## SydNay Observation
SydNay noted a B-flat resonance in the station’s copper ribs when the panther exhaled, a steady tone that seemed to harmonize with its fractal patterns and steady the ambient heat shimmer.
