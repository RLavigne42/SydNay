# Prism-Wing Chronometer

The Prism-Wing Chronometer was discovered during a midnight calibration sweep, its wings keeping impeccable 4/4 time as if the forest itself had learned to conduct. The first notes were mistaken for a municipal metronome before the glow of its plumage revealed an entirely new cadence.

## The Hybrid Entity
- **Chassis:** A polished brass sternum with gimbal joints, balanced like a pocket watch suspended on invisible springs.
- **Plumage:** Glassy prisms layered over carbon quills, refracting each tick into a fan of spectral afterimages.
- **Song:** A phase-locked hum that alternates between bell-like chimes and a soft susurrus of wind through reeds.

## SydNay’s Analysis
> "It sounds like a router inside a grandfather clock."

## Behavioral Oddity
When presented with a tuning key, the entity pauses mid-beat, aligns its prism feathers, and retunes to match the key’s pitch before resuming its 4/4 cycle.

| Observation | Field Notes | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tuning key reaction | Prism wings lock in unison, then release | The chronometer treats external pitch as a master clock |
| No key present | Rhythm drifts toward natural ambience | Suggests adaptive synchronization to its environment |

## Documentarian’s Realization
The notes were never merely mechanical; they were communal. The Guild wanted a Perfect Hum… The Forest gave them a Symphony.
