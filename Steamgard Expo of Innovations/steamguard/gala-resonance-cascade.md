# Gala Resonance Cascade

## Unveiling the Ornamental Oscillator

The gala opened with a velvet-draped plinth and a hush that swept across The Aetherium. SydNay’s notes record how the small ornamental oscillator looked harmless at first glance: a palm-sized brass sphere nested in filigreed ribs, its pendulum core ticking in a slow, dignified cadence. When the veil fell, the oscillator released a soft chime, as if announcing the Expo’s promise of refinement rather than upheaval.

## Resonance Cascade

The ornament’s chime deepened, repeating on a tempo the hall itself seemed to answer. What followed was cataloged as a resonance cascade.

- **Symptom:** Gaslight tremored in sync with the oscillator; metal fixtures vibrated; lacquered floors thrummed beneath the crowd.
- **Panic:** Guests clutched their masks, some fled toward the terraces, and others froze as the sound folded into a low, audible hum.
- **Physics:** Pressure waves doubled back on themselves, amplifying within the dome’s curves and creating a standing resonance that drowned the house orchestra.

## Moment of Intervention

SydNay describes the public Barnaby Method as a practiced ritual rather than a frantic response. Barnaby stood on the dais, raised the oscillator’s vented casing, and synchronized his breath with the device’s pulse. The audience watched as he tapped the casing with a tuning hammer in three evenly spaced strikes, breaking the standing wave before it could fully lock.

## Aftermath

> “The hush that returned was not silence, but respect for the line between wonder and hazard.”
