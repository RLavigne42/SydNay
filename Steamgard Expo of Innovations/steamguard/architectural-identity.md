# Architectural Identity: The Face of Steamgard

Steamgard embodies a philosophy of **functional elegance**, where industrial utility and Victorian grandeur are inseparable. The city’s skyline reads as a living machine, with architecture that looks engineered as much as it is built.

## Defining Visual Language

- **Primary materials:** Brass towers and copper domes dominate the city’s silhouette.
- **Ornamentation:** Buildings are adorned with visible gears, pipes, and mechanical motifs, making each structure feel like part of a larger apparatus.
- **The Aetherium:** Steamgard’s crown jewel, a grand conference hall crowned by an immense iron-and-glass dome that anchors the city’s intellectual life.
- **The streets:** Cobblestone roads form a dense network where steam-powered vehicles and vendor stalls create constant movement and commerce.

This blend of ornate craftsmanship and exposed mechanics gives Steamgard its unmistakable identity: a city that celebrates the beauty of function.
