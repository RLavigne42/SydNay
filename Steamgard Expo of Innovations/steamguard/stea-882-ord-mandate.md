# STEA-882 Order of Mandate: Steamguard Calibration Protocol

**Issuer:** Office of the Steamgard Expo Marshal, Steamguard Division
**Directive Code:** STEA-882-ORD
**Effective Date:** 14 Rainmoot 1887

## Core Directive

By authority of the Expo Marshal, all exhibitors, operators, and custodians of powered assemblies within the Steamgard Expo of Innovations shall implement the Steamguard Calibration Protocol. The protocol mandates uniform calibration, telemetry logging, and safety interlocks for every steam-bearing apparatus operating under Expo jurisdiction. All covered systems must be inspected, tuned, and recorded in accordance with the standards below to ensure public safety, mechanical integrity, and operational fairness across the exhibition floor.

## Technical Compliance Standards

- **Thermal Stability Index (TSI):** Maintain TSI within prescribed bounds using the calculation: `TSI = (ΔT_core / Δt_cycle) * (P_boiler / P_nominal)`.
- **Pressure Integrity Ratio (PIR):** Validate pressure integrity by meeting: `PIR = (P_vessel_max - P_vessel_min) / P_vessel_max`.
- **Kinetic Harmonization Factor (KHF):** Record kinetic harmonization as: `KHF = (ω_drive * τ_output) / (μ_damp * L_shaft)`.

## Barnaby Standardization Requirements

1. **Unified Gauge Calibration:** All gauges shall be aligned to Barnaby Standard Scale B-4 within ±1% tolerance prior to daily activation.
2. **Seal Verification Protocol:** Heat seals and rivet assemblies must pass dual-witness inspection and be logged in the Steamguard registry within 12 hours.
3. **Telemetry Ledger Format:** All telemetry records shall follow the Barnaby Ledger Schema (BLS-7) with indexed timestamps and operator signatures.
4. **Emergency Cutoff Compliance:** Manual and automatic cutoffs must actuate within 2.5 seconds of threshold breach, as verified by a certified Steamguard inspector.

## Compliance Timeline

| Milestone | Requirement | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial registration | Submit apparatus roster and baseline metrics | Within 5 days of notice |
| Calibration window | Complete TSI, PIR, and KHF verification | Within 10 days of notice |
| Audit readiness | Present Barnaby-compliant logs for review | Within 14 days of notice |
| Final certification | Receive Steamguard clearance seal | Before exhibition activation |

## Penalties and Enforcement

Failure to comply with STEA-882-ORD will result in immediate suspension of apparatus operation, forfeiture of exhibition privileges, and assessment of fines as determined by the Steamguard Enforcement Council. Repeat violations shall be referred to the Civic Fabrication Tribunal for escalated sanctions.
