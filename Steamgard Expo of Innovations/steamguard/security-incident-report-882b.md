# Steamgard Security & Oversight Bureau — Official Incident Report #882-B

**Date:** 17 Frostfall 984 A.E.  
**Location:** Steamgard Expo of Innovations, Cobblestone Road (adjacent to Vendor Stall #12)  
**Reporting Officer:** Inspector Lyra Voss, Steamgard Security & Oversight Bureau  
**Subject:** Containment breach involving experimental steam-traction carriage

## Incident Overview
At approximately 14:20 local time, an experimental steam-traction carriage designated for demonstration lost controlled traction and veered from its assigned lane near Vendor Stall #12 on Cobblestone Road. The conveyance collided with a vendor booth awning and ruptured a minor steam line, causing a brief pressure release and localized disruption to foot traffic before the unit was halted under emergency protocol.

## Impact Assessment

| Area | Impact Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor Stall #12 | Awning torn, display cases damaged, inventory scattered; no structural collapse. |
| Cobblestone Road | Surface scuffed and displaced stones; temporary closure required for safety cordon. |
| Infrastructure | Minor steam line rupture; emergency valves engaged to prevent escalation. |
| Civilians | Three minor steam exposure cases treated on-site; no hospital transfers required. |

## Officer’s Log & Testimony

> “The carriage’s pressure gauge spiked beyond safe tolerance without audible warning. I observed a sudden vent of white steam and the vehicle lurched toward the vendor line. Emergency brakes failed to engage on first attempt; manual override succeeded on second, after which I ordered a full shutdown and evacuation of the immediate lane.”

## Resolution & Recovery

- Manual override engaged to halt the carriage and vent excess pressure.
- Device seized for mechanical audit and custody transfer to the Bureau’s engineering division.
- Vendor compensation initiated for Stall #12 and adjacent vendors impacted by debris.

## Final Recommendation
Future transport of experimental steam-traction units should be routed via subterranean tunnels to eliminate pedestrian exposure during transit and staging.

**Status:** Closed — under review for engineering compliance updates.
