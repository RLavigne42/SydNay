# Internal Guild Response: Project ‘Resonance’

SydNay,

Your invitation to present Project “Resonance” at the Steamgard Expo of Innovations is hereby accepted on behalf of the Artisans’ Guild. We recognize the potential of this work to elevate the city’s collaborative craft and are prepared to proceed with the appropriate guild-sanctioned support and oversight.

The core of Project “Resonance” is the Aether-Pulse Oscillator: a calibrated array designed to stabilize ambient aether flows and translate them into a sustained mechanical cadence suitable for public demonstration. Initial trials confirm that the oscillator’s rhythmic output can be coupled to common steamworks without significant energy loss.

## Project Codename

- **Mechanism:** The Aether-Pulse Oscillator synchronizes aetheric surges into a repeatable waveform through phased copper coils and resonant brass harmonics.
- **Result:** A steady, low-heat power cadence capable of driving exhibition-grade automata and precision timing displays.

Note: A minor vibration has been detected in the Aetherium’s dome glass during peak resonance. We will install dampening gears and counterweights along the dome’s support ring before the public exhibition to prevent harmonic stress.

By the Gear and the Flame, Master Artisan Valerius Thorne — Prime Overseer of the Artisans’ Guild

*Guild Note:* Clear Sky sensors will be recalibrated to ignore the oscillator’s aetheric signature during the demonstration window.
