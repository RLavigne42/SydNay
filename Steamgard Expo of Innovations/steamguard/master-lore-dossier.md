## Urban Geography (Surface vs. Deep)
**Surface (Ornate Elegance):**
- Brass towers, copper domes, and civic grandeur define the skyline.
- The Aetherium serves as the ceremonial and intellectual hub.
- The Expo sits at the social core, where innovations are displayed publicly.

**Deep (Industrial Functionality):**
- Sub-Sector tunnels host pressure systems, resonance infrastructure, and maintenance guilds.
- Steam arteries and retrofitted valves keep the city’s “breath” stable.
- The deep city is the counterbalance that prevents surface perfection from becoming brittle.

## Technical Specifications Repository
**P-1 (Pressure Node Prototype):**
- Purpose: First-generation pressure calibration node for balancing surface and deep systems.
- Status: Prototype reference unit for resonance-safe retrofits.
- Key readouts:
  - Pressure differential: **ΔP = [placeholder]**
  - Thermal drift: **ΔT = [placeholder]**
  - Harmonic loss factor: **η = [placeholder]**

**Aether-Pulse Oscillator:**
- Purpose: Synchronizes city-wide steam systems into the “Perfect Hum.”
- Risk: Over-amplification can trigger resonance cascade in rigid structures.
- Formula placeholders:
  - Resonant frequency: **f = [placeholder]**
  - Acoustic impedance: **Z = [placeholder]**
  - Damping coefficient: **ζ = [placeholder]**

## Dramatis Personae
- **SydNay** — Lead documentarian and narrative anchor of the Steamgard archive.
- **Master Valerius Thorne** — Primary guild authority driving the Oscillator initiative.
- **Artisans’ Guild** — Engineering leadership, custodians of civic innovation.
- **Inventors** — Cultural elite who unveil breakthroughs at the Expo.
- **Sub-Sector Keepers** — Deep-city maintainers who stabilize the city’s heartbeat.

## Philosophical Core
Steamgard is defined by the tension between **Ornate Elegance** (surface aspiration) and **Industrial Functionality** (deep necessity). The city’s stability is earned when perfection yields to flexibility—when the mechanical heart is allowed to “sigh” rather than strain.

**Lore Status:** Canon — Steamgard Chronicles (Expo Era).
**Continuity Note:** The Oscillator crisis and subsequent retrofits are fixed anchors for future narratives.
**Open Threads:** Cross-realm resonance impacts and the broader SydNay odyssey.
