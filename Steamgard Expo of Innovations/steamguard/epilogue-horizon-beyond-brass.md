# Epilogue: Horizon Beyond Brass

## Triple-World Nexus
The closing map of the expedition charts a Triple-World Nexus where the Silk Rails, the Silicon Rainforest, and the Bitstream Wilderness converge into a single compass rose. This triad is described as a living exchange of craft, code, and canopy, with the Silicon Rainforest humming in bioelectric cadence beside the shifting trails of the Bitstream Wilderness.

> Documentarian’s Final Field Note:
> We traced the last auric thread across the skyline and found a horizon that was not an edge, but a hinge. The city did not end; it transposed into a new key, and every traveler carried the melody forward.

## State of the World
The Steamgard Expo of Innovations closes with alliances intact, the skyways repaired, and the guilds aligned toward a shared atlas. Makers return to their workshops with new harmonics, archivists seal their ledgers, and the compass of the age points toward cooperative discovery instead of conquest.

SydNay Odyssey, onward.
