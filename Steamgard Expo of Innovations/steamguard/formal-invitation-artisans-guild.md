# Office of the Documentarian — The Aetherium, Steamgard Central

## Formal Summons to Innovation

**To:** The Master Artisans and High-Guild Members  
**Attention:** The Artisans’ Guild of Steamgard

From the copper domes of The Aetherium to the brass towers that define the city’s skyline, your craftsmanship remains the steady pulse of Steamgard’s progress. This formal summons is issued with gentle authority to secure your presence and participation in the upcoming Expo of Innovations. The January archive records the Guild’s last exhibition with distinction, and this year’s showing is expected to surpass it in clarity, precision, and ambition.

## Exhibition Mandates

- Prioritize inventions that advance public utility and civic stewardship.
- Present mechanisms that demonstrate durability under prolonged public viewing.
- Provide concise documentation for archiving and future replication.
- Maintain alignment with the Expo’s standards for safety and refinement.

## Logistics & Presentation

All Guild representatives are to arrive at The Aetherium intake hall no later than the eve before the Expo opens. Each submission must include a brief operational overview, a display placard, and a designated attendant for public questions. Demonstration timing will be scheduled by the Office of the Documentarian to ensure balanced circulation across the exhibition floors.

**Note to the Guild:** All instruments must be fully calibrated and verified against Steamgard safety standards prior to intake to preserve the public trust and the integrity of the archive.

With Gentle Authority,  
SydNay — Lead Documentarian & Observer — Steamgard Chronicles
