The morning opens with the sky’s famous emptiness—no airships or aerial clutter—so the city’s marvels keep their feet on the ground. SydNay walks the cobblestones toward the Expo gates, cataloging how Steamgard’s functional elegance shows up in every brass bracket and copper dome.

Her entry log ends with a simple line: “The city’s genius is always at street level, where gears meet hands.”
