# Day 7 — The Sigh Below the Streets

The Expo’s polish sends SydNay underground to Sub-Sector 9, where the city’s steam-tunnels reveal their rattles and groans. Old Barnaby speaks of the Barnaby Method: a city needs a sigh as much as it needs a hum. He presses a soot-stained tuning key into her palm and teaches her to listen for the moment when a machine asks to breathe.

SydNay returns topside with a new lens on the Expo—a promise to document not just brilliance, but the pressure that brilliance creates.
