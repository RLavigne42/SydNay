# Day 9 — The SIGH Retrofit Ledger

SydNay joins the structural works team to review the Aetherium Dome SIGH Retrofit Initiative. The SIGH ring array and whisper joints promise stability without erasing the dome’s grandeur, and the Thorne-Barnaby Equilibrium is logged as a new standard rather than a footnote. She signs the ledger with the conviction that the dome will sing no louder than the crowd beneath it.

The Expo’s mandate tightens as well: STEA-882 calibration protocols now demand consistent telemetry, inspection, and emergency cutoffs. SydNay notes that safety and spectacle can coexist, but only when the city agrees to keep listening.
