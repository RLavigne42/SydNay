# Day 1 — The Summons in Brass

SydNay arrives at the Steamgard Expo of Innovations precinct and finds a formal summons waiting in the intake hall. The invitation carries the Office of the Documentarian’s tone of gentle authority, reminding the Artisans’ Guild to present durable, publicly useful mechanisms and to appear at The Aetherium on the eve of opening day. SydNay reads the lines aloud to herself, letting the cadence set the rhythm for her own itinerary. The brass towers and copper domes she sees beyond the letter match the language on the page, a city that speaks in metal and mandate.

She tucks the invitation into her field case and decides to treat it as a ten-day charter: a promise to witness the Expo from first calibration to final archive entry.
