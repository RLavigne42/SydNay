# Day 8 — The Gilded Gear Warning

At the Grand Gala of the Gilded Gear, the Aetherium glitters with brass chandeliers and measured waltz steps. The ornamental oscillator’s chime deepens, and the dome answers with a tremor. SydNay hears the rising hum as a warning rather than a triumph. When the resonance climbs toward a cascade, she watches the Barnaby Method break the standing wave—three measured taps, a synchronized breath, and a controlled release.

The hush that follows is not silence, but respect for the line between wonder and hazard.
