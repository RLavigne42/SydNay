# Day 5 — The Sky-Pedaler’s Discipline

SydNay watches a Model P-1 “Sky-Pedaler” demonstration. The single-rider gyrocopter blends ornate aerodynamics with working grit—brass lattice, copper sheathing, and a variable-ratio gear array that requires the pilot’s full effort. It is an invention that asks its rider to earn every span of lift, and the Expo crowd responds with admiration rather than envy.

SydNay notes how the machine embodies Steamguard’s ethic: refinement and labor must coexist, and a polished machine is also a working one.
