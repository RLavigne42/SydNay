# Day 4 — Under the Iron-and-Glass Dome

Inside The Aetherium, SydNay stands beneath the iron-and-glass canopy that anchors Steamguard’s intellectual life. The dome hums with layered sound: steam hiss, brass clack, and the soft rhythm of prototypes being tuned. She studies the Aether-Pulse Oscillator prototype—Resonance—in its cradle, noting the Great Tuning Array and the warning to proceed with steady hands and steadier intent.

Her journal closes the day with a reminder: a perfect frequency is a tempting myth, but a living city breathes before it aligns.
