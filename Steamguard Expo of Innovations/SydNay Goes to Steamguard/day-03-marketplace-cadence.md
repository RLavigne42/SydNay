# Day 3 — Marketplace Cadence

SydNay spends the day among inventors, artisans, adventurers, and vendors, each class declaring their purpose through gear-worked attire. Fashion here is functional, and the market becomes a parade of utility—belts that power tools, cuffs that secure instruments, corsets that double as harnesses. Steamguard’s social order feels less like hierarchy and more like an engine: each role feeds the Great Machine of progress.

She records the soundscape: clacking displays, measured debate, and the satisfied murmur of a city that measures merit by invention rather than lineage.
