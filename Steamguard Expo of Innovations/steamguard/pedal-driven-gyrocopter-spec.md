# Technical Specification: Model P-1 “Sky-Pedaler”

**Classification:** Personal Aetherlift Conveyance (Pedal-Driven Gyrocopter)  
**Manufacturer:** Master Thorne’s Aeromechanical Atelier, Steamgard

## Core Statistics

| Attribute | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Crew** | Single rider (adventurer-class harness compatible). |
| **Propulsion** | Dual-crank pedal drive with variable-ratio gearing. |
| **Cruising Speed** | 18 knots in clear sky, 12 knots in urban turbulence. |
| **Operational Range** | 40 leagues per Aether-Oil cycle. |
| **Lift Envelope** | Stable between 30–220 spans above street level. |
| **Frame Materials** | Brass lattice, copper sheathing, tempered spruce spars. |
| **Safety Load** | Counterweighted balance rig rated for 1.3x rider mass. |

## Key Mechanical Features

- **Variable-ratio gearing:** A stepped cog array allows riders to shift between torque for vertical ascent and cadence for forward glide, keeping the craft responsive in Steamgard’s narrow air corridors.
- **Ornate aerodynamics:** Curved copper fairings and filigreed vanes reduce drag while reinforcing Steamgard’s signature blend of elegance and function.
- **Safety counterweights:** A paired ballast system auto-levels the rotor mast, mitigating sudden gusts funneling between copper domes.
- **Instrumentation:** A compact brass dial cluster tracks cadence, lift pressure, and crosswind angle for precise navigation.

## Operational Lore

The Model P-1 was formally logged during the **January 11th Session (Group 3.10–3.12)**, noted as a solution to the congestion of cobblestone roads during Expo week. Adventurer-class riders favor the Sky-Pedaler for rapid rooftop traversal, using it as a secondary transport when steam carriages crowd the street grid.

## Maintenance Note

Apply **Aether‑Oil** lubrication every **40 leagues** of travel to the pedal shaft and rotor spindle. Operators are expected to observe the **“Ornate Elegance”** social code: polished brass, intact filigree, and no visible oil smear when landing in high-society districts.

## SydNay’s Evaluation

SydNay’s field note commends the craft for embodying *relentless determination*—a machine that asks the rider to contribute every turn of the crank—while serving as a cultural symbol of Steamgard’s belief that refinement and labor must coexist.
