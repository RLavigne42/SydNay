## Must-Visit Landmarks

| Landmark | Why It Matters | Best Time to Visit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Aetherium | The city's luminous heart and a showcase of resonance-powered marvels. | Dawn, when the prisms ignite. |
| Marketplace Clocktower | A central hub for trade, timekeeping, and rumor exchange. | Midday bell, when contracts are sealed. |
| The Prime Forge | Ancestral engineworks where guilds reveal their finest mechanisms. | Evening shift-change, for demonstrations. |

## Understanding "The Sigh"

**Safety advisory:** The Sigh is a sustained, low-frequency resonance that some visitors report as a persistent pressure behind the eyes. If you feel discomfort, step into a stone-lined corridor and breathe slowly.

- **B-flat hum note:** Stay alert for the B-flat overtone that signals a surge; it typically lasts 9–12 seconds.

## Transportation & Logistics

Steamgard's transit charter is governed by the **Clear Sky ordinance**, which restricts low-altitude flight above the civic core.

## Fashion & Professional Etiquette

- **Inventors:** Favor layered aprons with insulated cuffs; keep tools visibly tagged.
- **Artisans:** Wear dye-fast wraps and carry a sample card to prove guild standing.
- **Adventurers:** Secure cloaks with copper clasps to prevent gear snags in gearworks.
- **SydNay Standard:** A polished brass pin at the lapel denotes respect for the Expo.
