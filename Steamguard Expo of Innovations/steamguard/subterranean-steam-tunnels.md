# Subterranean Steam Tunnels

Clear Sky favors the surface with its bright glass roofs and wind-scrubbed avenues, while the subterranean atmosphere clings to Steamgard’s undercity in warm, soot-laced breaths and a constant hiss of pressure.

## The Sub-City: Steamgard’s Subterranean Arteries

Below the boulevards, architecture shifts from sunlit brass facades to riveted iron ribs and stacked catwalks that frame the tunnels like a mechanical ribcage. Pressure readings follow the maintenance placeholder formula: **P(depth) = ___**. Infrastructure notes: condensate returns run along the eastern seams, heat exchangers are stacked in trios at junction nodes, and emergency vent stacks must remain clear of slag.

## SydNay’s Descent

> “The air tastes of copper and old storms, and every step down feels like a heartbeat in the city’s own chest.”

## The Impounded Oscillator: Relocated Testing

- **Status:** Relocated to the quiet southern spur under lock.
- **Safety protocol:** Triple-seal valves engaged; observers remain behind the amber barrier.
- **Observation:** The harmonic pulse steadied after the fourth cycle, but the walls still tremble on the fifth.

## Guild Log: Tunnel Stability Report

| Segment | Stability Rating | Last Survey | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A3 | Stable | 23 Frostwake | Minor seep at valve joint |
| B7 | Watch | 18 Frostwake | Audible ping during peak load |
| C2 | Reinforce | 12 Frostwake | Reinforce struts before next thaw |
| D9 | Stable | 21 Frostwake | Vent fans cleared |

The iron walls sing in unison, a deep chord that rolls through the tunnels and reminds every traveler that Steamgard’s heart beats beneath their feet.
