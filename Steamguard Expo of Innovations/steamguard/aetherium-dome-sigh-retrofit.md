# Aetherium Dome SIGH Retrofit

**Project Header:** Aetherium Dome SIGH Retrofit Initiative
**Classification:** Structural Integrity, Habitable Envelope, Heritage Preservation
**Lead Engineer:** SydNay, Steamgard Expo Structural Works

## Structural Overview

The retrofit introduces the SIGH (Stabilized Inertial Geometry Harness) ring to reinforce the Aetherium dome without disrupting its public canopy. The design preserves the dome’s iron-and-glass lattice while distributing uplift and torsional forces into a discreet substructure network.

## Components Table

| Component | Description | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SIGH Ring Array | Concentric ring of calibrated brass ribs | Absorbs torsional surge and balances dome sway |
| Aetherium Spine Struts | Reinforced iron struts anchored to pillar cores | Transfers load to primary supports |
| Whisper Joints | Vibration-isolated couplers with copper bushings | Dampens resonance during storm events |
| Etherglass Canopy Plates | Replacement glass segments with stress channels | Maintains visibility while shedding microfractures |
| Vaulted Anchor Collars | Circumferential collars around base columns | Prevents lateral drift in the lower ring |

## Physics

### Thorne-Barnaby Equilibrium

The dome’s stability is governed by the Thorne-Barnaby Equilibrium, wherein rotational inertia is counterbalanced by induced radial compression in the SIGH ring array.

### Stress-Displacement Formula (Placeholder)

\[
\sigma(r, \theta) = \text{TBD}(\Delta, \kappa, \Omega)
\]

## Manual Override

In the event of automated dampener failure, quarter-turn access keys at each pillar core engage the SIGH ring lock and allow manual tension resets.
