# Archive Statistics and Evolution

The Steamgard documentation is a focused visual archive that grew quickly through iterative refinement.

## Key Metrics

- **Total images:** 79
- **Creation window:** Intensive two-day period in January 2024

## Refinement Process

- Prompts evolved from broad environmental descriptions to **text-free** constraints.
- This shift kept worldbuilding focused on architecture and characters rather than AI-generated typography.

## Focus Split

- **Environment and locations:** ~27%
- **SydNay integrated into scenes:** ~73%

This balance underscores the archive’s dual purpose: to define Steamgard’s places while anchoring them through a consistent observer.
