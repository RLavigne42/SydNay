# Society and the Culture of Innovation

Steamgard measures status by contribution to the **Great Machine** of progress. Social roles are organized by craft and discovery, and identity is reflected in both work and attire.

## Professional Classes

| Class | Role in Society |
| --- | --- |
| Inventors | Cultural elite and primary drivers of Steamgard’s technological pride. |
| Artisans | Skilled craftspeople who turn designs into functional mechanisms. |
| Adventurers | Risk-takers who fuel expeditions and discoveries. |
| Vendors | Backbone of street commerce, distributing gear-driven wares. |

## Cultural Notes

- **Fashion is functional.** Clothing blends elegance with purpose, often featuring brass accents and mechanical elements that signal a person’s profession.
- **Merit is mechanical.** Social mobility comes from invention, craftsmanship, and innovation rather than lineage.

Steamgard’s society is therefore a living workshop: a place where identity is forged through contribution, and style is always tied to utility.
