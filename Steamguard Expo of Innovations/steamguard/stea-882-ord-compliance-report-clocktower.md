# STEA-882 Ordinance Compliance Report: Clocktower

## Facility Overview
The Clocktower facility serves as the timekeeping heart of the Steamgard Expo of Innovations, housing the primary oscillation chamber, auxiliary bellworks, and pressure management conduits that synchronize the Expo grounds. The structure integrates steam-driven regulators with mechanical gearing to maintain uniform cadence across exhibition wings.

## Visual Inspection
- Sigh-valves: Seals intact, seats aligned, and lever action responsive without audible chatter.
- Expansion couplers: No visible cracking; joints exhibit even spacing and stable anchor points.
- Surface condition: External housings show light patina with no pitting; fasteners remain free of corrosion.

## Stress Test Observations
- Oscillation array recorded steady pulses at **[HZ-PLACEHOLDER] Hz** with coefficient range **[COEFF-PLACEHOLDER]** across the primary chamber.
- Pressure relief cycle held consistent phase timing under the provided notes, with no drift beyond the placeholder tolerances.
- Thermal bloom remained within expected variance; coupling strain tracked to **[COEFF-PLACEHOLDER]** under peak load conditions.

## Barnaby Verification
- Confirmed calibration stamps on regulator housings.
- Verified manual override integrity during staged shutdown.
- Logged alignment readings against ordinance thresholds.

## Final Verdict
The Clocktower facility meets STEA-882 compliance requirements with all inspected systems operating within acceptable parameters. Next inspection is scheduled for **[NEXT-INSPECTION-DATE]**.

Thorne observed the final readings and offered a measured nod, noting the steady cadence as a sign the tower remains fit for the season ahead.
