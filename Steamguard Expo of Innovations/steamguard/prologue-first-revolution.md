# Prologue: First Revolution

## Prime Gear Origin Story

Elias Thorne arrived in Steamgard with a soot-blackened valise and a watchmaker’s patience. He found Silas Barnaby in a shuttered bell foundry, where the furnaces slept and the anvils were cold. Together they listened for the hidden rhythm of the city and drafted the idea that would become the Prime Gear: a master cog meant to harmonize every clock, piston, and pressure valve with a single, precise cadence. Thorne etched the first teeth by hand; Barnaby tempered the alloy until it held a promise of motion. Their nights were spent measuring the breath of steam itself, charting a map of force that could lift a city into synchronous life.

When the gear finally turned, they knew it was not merely a mechanism but a covenant. The Prime Gear’s rotation was the city’s first agreed heartbeat, a foundation stone for all inventions that followed. What began as a pair of restless minds became the quiet vow that Steamgard would never again stall in darkness.

## First Calculation

Thorne’s slate still bears the smudged rubric that bound their first engine to the laws of motion:

```
τ = [torque formula placeholder]
```

The line was less a solution than a promise to keep measuring, to keep refining the balance between power and restraint.

## First Sigh

The moment came as a quarter-turn, a hesitant breath of metal. The Prime Gear’s spokes eased forward, and a hiss of steam slipped through the valve like a sigh of relief. Barnaby counted the teeth under his breath while Thorne watched the pressure glass settle, both men holding still as if noise might unmake the miracle. The city did not roar; it inhaled, and the quarter-turn became the first step of a revolution.

## Legacy of the Foundation

The Foundation keeps the Prime Gear’s housing polished, its chamber lit by amber lamps. Apprentices trace its rotation in their notebooks, learning that innovation begins with reverence. Every new machine is introduced to its cadence, every new inventor taught the story of the night it turned.

> Documentarian’s Note: The Prime Gear is less a relic than a reminder. In its measured arc we read the oath of Thorne and Barnaby—to build with care, to measure with honesty, and to trust in the quiet power of a single, steadfast turn.
