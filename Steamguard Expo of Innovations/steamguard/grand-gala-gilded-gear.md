# Grand Gala of the Gilded Gear

## Atmosphere
The Aetherium’s dome glitters beneath tiered chandeliers of brass and crystal, each flame steadied by whispering gearwork. Attendees in lacquered tails and corseted finery glide across the mosaic floor, their movements measured and precise, while the orchestra threads a waltz through the air like a polished current of steam. Velvet banners and filigreed columns frame the dais, and even the servants move in disciplined cadence, as if decorum itself is another instrument in the ensemble.

## The Confrontation: SydNay and Master Thorne
“Master Thorne, the hum is climbing,” SydNay said, her gaze fixed on the vibrating rim of the dome.

“It is the sound of perfection,” Thorne replied, fingers tightening around the oscillator’s tuning key. “Listen to how the city aligns.”

“The city is groaning, not aligning,” SydNay answered. “You have forced a frequency the iron will not carry.”

“Equations do not groan,” Thorne said. “They resolve.”

“They do when they are written over a living structure,” SydNay said, stepping toward the pressure valve. “Let me turn it before the gala becomes a requiem.”

## The Hidden Truth
| Thorne’s View | SydNay’s Reality |
| --- | --- |
| The Aether-Pulse Oscillator is the final proof of Steamgard’s mastery. | The oscillator exposes the dome’s stress limits and demands humility. |
| Precision alone brings harmony. | Harmony requires listening to the city’s living cadence. |
| The gala must showcase an unbroken “Perfect Hum.” | A controlled release preserves both the people and the myth. |
| Data is the only truth worth presenting. | Observation and lived experience complete the record. |

## The Documentarian’s Choice
SydNay chose to record the moment as both celebration and warning, refusing to edit out the tremor beneath the music. She documented Thorne’s brilliance alongside the strain in the brass, framing the gala as a lesson that perfection is not a command but a conversation.

Steamgard kept its splendor, but the chorus softened.
The documentarian sealed the night in ink and light.
