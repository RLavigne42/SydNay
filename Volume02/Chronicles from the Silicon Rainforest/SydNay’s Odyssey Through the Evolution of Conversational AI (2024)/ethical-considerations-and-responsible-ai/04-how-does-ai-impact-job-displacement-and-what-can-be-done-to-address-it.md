# How does AI impact job displacement, and what can be done to address it?

**Late Afternoon:**

The impact of AI on job displacement is a pressing concern. To address this, businesses can:
1. **Upskill and reskill the workforce**: Invest in employee training and development to adapt to changing job requirements.
2. **Create new job opportunities**: Develop new roles and industries that leverage AI capabilities.
3. **Implement responsible AI deployment**: Ensure that AI systems are designed to augment human capabilities, rather than replace them.
