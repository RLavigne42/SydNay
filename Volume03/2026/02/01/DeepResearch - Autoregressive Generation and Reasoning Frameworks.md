# **The Renaissance of Discrete Modeling: Autoregressive Frameworks in Vision, Video, and Reasoning**

## **1\. Introduction: The Convergence of Generative Paradigms**

The trajectory of generative artificial intelligence has historically been defined by a schism between modalities, dictated largely by the underlying nature of the data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) flourished under the discrete, sequential paradigm of Autoregressive (AR) modeling—specifically, "next-token prediction"—which culminated in the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of emergent reasoning and few-shot generalization. In contrast, Computer Vision (CV) initially experimented with autoregression but, faced with the high-dimensional continuity of pixel data, largely pivoted toward diffusion-based probabilistic models (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models or DDPMs) and continuous flow matching. These continuous frameworks offered superior fidelity and avoided the artifacts associated with discretizing the visual world, establishing a dominance that seemed unassailable by the early 2020s.

However, the landscape is undergoing a profound structural shift in the 2024-2025 horizon. The emergence of **Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR)**, **Unified Multimodal Models** (such as Llama 4 and Chameleon), and **Autoregressive Reasoning Frameworks** signals a convergence where the discrete "next-token" paradigm is being successfully adapted to visual, temporal, and action domains. This resurgence is not merely a nostalgic return to older architectures but a fundamental reinvention of how visual data is represented, ordered, and generated. By solving the "tokenization bottleneck" through techniques like Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and replacing the linear raster-scan with hierarchical "next-scale" prediction, researchers have unlocked autoregressive models that scale predictably with compute, offering inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than diffusion while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art fidelity.

Furthermore, this unification allows for the integration of **Autoregressive Reasoning**—specifically Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Process Reward Models (PRM)—into generative workflows. This moves the field beyond stochastic pattern matching toward "System 2" generative AI: models that plan, verify, and reason about the content they create. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of these frameworks, examining the architectural innovations, scaling laws, and reasoning mechanisms that are defining the next era of unified artificial intelligence.

**2\. The Discrete Foundation: Advanced Visual Tokenization**

The fundamental prerequisite for applying autoregressive transformers to vision is the transformation of continuous signals (images, video) into a discrete "language" that a transformer can model. This process, tokenization, historically served as the primary bottleneck for visual AR. The transition from naive discretization to high-fidelity, lookup-free quantization represents the first pillar of the autoregressive renaissance.

### **2.1 The Mathematical Limits of Vector Quantization (VQ)**

The standard approach, established by VQ-VAE and refined by VQGAN, involves an encoder compressing an image into a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized to the nearest neighbor in a learnable codebook.

#### **2.1.1 Mechanism and Codebook Collapse**

Formally, an input image ![][image1] is encoded into a continuous latent representation ![][image2]. This continuous vector is mapped to a discrete vector ![][image3] selected from a learnable codebook ![][image4], where ![][image5] is the vocabulary size. The quantization operation is defined as a nearest-neighbor lookup:

![][image6]  
While theoretically sound, this mechanism suffers from **codebook collapse**, a phenomenon where the model utilizes only a small subset of the available vocabulary (e.g., using 100 codes out of 8,192). This collapse occurs because the gradients for the codebook embeddings are approximated (often via Straight-Through Estimators), leading to a "winner-takes-all" dynamic where frequently used codes get updated to be even closer to the data distribution, while rarely used codes drift away and "die".1

Early mitigation strategies involved complex auxiliary losses, such as "commitment loss" to constrain the encoder's output variance, and exponential moving average (EMA) updates to stabilize the codebook vectors. However, these heuristics introduced training instability and limited the effective vocabulary size, capping the fidelity of the reconstructed image—a ceiling that diffusion models did not face.

### **2.2 Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ): Implicit Codebooks**

To eliminate the complexity and instability of learnable codebooks, **Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ)** was introduced as a radical simplification. FSQ abandons the nearest-neighbor lookup entirely in favor of direct scalar projection.

#### **2.2.1 Dimensional Projection and Quantization**

In FSQ, the VAE bottleneck projects the latent representation down to a very low-dimensional space (typically ![][image7]). Each dimension is then independently quantized to a small set of fixed integer values. If we define a set of levels ![][image8] for each dimension ![][image9], the quantization function ![][image10] is:

![][image11]  
The effective "codebook" becomes the Cartesian product of these scalar levels. For example, a projection into ![][image12] dimensions, each quantized to 8 levels, yields an effective vocabulary size of ![][image13].

#### **2.2.2 Advantages over VQ**

This approach offers three critical advantages:

1. **Training Stability:** FSQ removes the need for commitment losses, codebook splitting, or reseeding. The gradients flow naturally through the scalar rounding operation.  
2. **Implicit Vocabulary:** The model can access a massive vocabulary without the memory cost of storing embedding vectors. The "code" is simply the concatenation of the integer values.  
3. **Disentanglement:** By treating dimensions independently, FSQ encourages the model to learn disentangled representations (e.g., one dimension encoding color, another texture), which aids the autoregressive model in learning the structure of the data.4

### **2.3 Lookup-Free Quantization (LFQ) for Video**

Video data exacerbates the tokenization challenge by adding a temporal dimension (![][image14]), leading to an exponential increase in the number of tokens required to represent a sequence. Standard VQ tables become prohibitively large when trying to capture the nuance of motion. **Lookup-Free Quantization (LFQ)**, employed in state-of-the-art video models like **MAGVIT-v2**, represents the apex of high-efficiency tokenization.

#### **2.3.1 Binary Latents and Zero-Memory Overhead**

LFQ takes the scalar quantization concept to its logical extreme: binary quantization. The latent vector components are quantized based on their sign:

![][image15]  
This binary vector is then converted directly into an integer index in the range ![][image16]. For a latent dimension of ![][image17], this yields a vocabulary of ![][image18] tokens.

Unlike standard VQ, which requires an ![][image19] embedding table and ![][image20] compute for the nearest-neighbor search, LFQ has zero memory overhead for the codebook and ![][image21] compute. This allows MAGVIT-v2 to utilize massive vocabularies, essential for capturing fine-grained temporal dynamics in video, without the memory bottleneck. Research indicates that this high-capacity tokenization is the primary factor enabling AR models to surpass diffusion in video generation benchmarks.6

## ---

**3\. The Next-Scale Paradigm: Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR)**

With the tokenization bottleneck addressed, the second challenge for visual AR was the **sequence ordering**. Language is naturally 1D and causal (left-to-right). Images are 2D and non-causal. For years, models like ImageGPT attempted to force 2D images into a 1D "raster scan" (row-by-row), creating artificial long-range dependencies where spatially adjacent pixels (e.g., ![][image22] and ![][image23]) were separated by hundreds of steps in the sequence. This ![][image24] complexity made high-resolution generation computationally prohibitive.

The breakthrough in 2024-2025 has been the abandonment of the raster scan in favor of **Next-Scale Prediction**, a paradigm instantiated by **Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR)**.

### **3.1 Architecture: From Next-Token to Next-Scale**

VAR fundamentally reformulates the probability distribution of an image. Instead of modeling the joint probability as a product of individual tokens ![][image25]:

![][image26]  
VAR decomposes the image into a hierarchical pyramid of scales ![][image27], where each scale ![][image28] represents the complete token map at resolution ![][image29] (e.g., ![][image30]).

![][image31]

#### **3.1.1 Parallel Generation within Scales**

Crucially, VAR assumes that all tokens *within* a specific scale ![][image28] are conditionally independent given the coarser scales ![][image32]. This allows the transformer to predict the entire ![][image33] token map in a single parallel forward pass.

1. **Step 1:** Condition on \`\`, predict ![][image34] map (Global Layout).  
2. **Step 2:** Condition on ![][image34], predict ![][image35] map.  
3. **Step K:** Condition on previous maps, predict ![][image36] map.

This reduces the number of autoregressive steps from ![][image37] (total pixels, e.g., 256 or 1024\) to ![][image5] (number of scales, typically ![][image38]). This structural shift results in inference speeds approximately **20x faster** than raster-scan AR baselines and **45x faster** than Diffusion Transformers (DiT), fundamentally altering the economics of visual generation.1

### **3.2 Scaling Laws: The Alpha Coefficients**

One of the most significant empirical findings in the VAR research is the validation of **Power-Law Scaling Laws** for visual generation, mirroring those famously established for LLMs by Kaplan et al.

![][image39]  
where ![][image40] is the test loss and ![][image37] is the parameter count or compute budget.

Research on VAR models ranging from 18M to 2B parameters demonstrates a smooth power-law curve with a linear correlation coefficient of nearly **\-0.998**. Unlike diffusion models, which often face saturation points or require complex schedule tuning to scale, visual AR models exhibit a "free lunch" property where increasing model size and data reliably reduces FID and cross-entropy loss. This predictability is critical for industrial-scale training, suggesting that visual intelligence follows the same thermodynamic-like laws as textual intelligence.10

### **3.3 Advanced Architectures: FlexVAR and FlowAR**

The original VAR architecture has rapidly evolved into more specialized variants to address specific limitations.

#### **3.3.1 FlexVAR: Flexible Autoregressive Modeling**

Original VAR models predicted the *residual* difference between scales, which coupled the scales tightly and enforced a rigid generation order. **FlexVAR** removes this constraint by training the model to predict the "ground truth" token map at each scale directly.

* **Zero-Shot Adaptability:** By decoupling the scales, FlexVAR allows for variable inference steps (e.g., skipping scales for speed) and handling arbitrary aspect ratios that don't fit the perfect pyramid.  
* **Capabilities:** It excels at zero-shot image editing, such as outpainting (expanding the canvas) and inpainting, because it can condition on a partial context at any scale without retraining. A 1.0B FlexVAR model achieves an FID of **2.08** in zero-shot inference, demonstrating that flexibility does not require a compromise in quality.13

#### **3.3.2 FlowAR: Merging Discrete Planning with Continuous Refinement**

While discrete AR is excellent for global structure ("where is the cat?"), it inherently quantizes high-frequency details ("what is the texture of the fur?"). **FlowAR** addresses this by integrating **Flow Matching**—a continuous generative method—into the scale-wise AR framework.

* **Hybrid Mechanism:** The autoregressive transformer acts as a "Planner," predicting the latent distribution for the next scale. A Flow Matching head then acts as a "Renderer," transforming noise into the continuous features of that scale conditioned on the AR plan.  
* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** This hybrid approach achieves an FID of **1.65** on ImageNet ![][image41], surpassing both pure VAR (1.73) and pure Diffusion (DiT-XL/2 at 2.27). It represents the current apex of visual modeling: discrete structural reasoning combined with continuous textural refinement.16

### **3.4 Table 1: Comparative Performance of Visual Frameworks (ImageNet 256x256)**

| Model Architecture | Paradigm | Parameters | FID (Lower is Better) | IS (Higher is Better) | Inference Speed (Relative) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **VQGAN-AR** | Raster AR | \~500M | 18.65 | 80.4 | 1x (Baseline) |
| **DiT-XL/2** | Diffusion | 675M | 2.27 | 278.2 | \~0.5x |
| **SiT-XL/2** | Interpolant | 675M | 2.06 | 270.3 | \~0.6x |
| **VAR-d30** | Next-Scale AR | 2.0B | 1.97 | 311.4 | **\~20x** |
| **FlexVAR** | Flexible AR | 1.0B | 2.08 (Zero-shot) | 315.7 | Variable |
| **FlowAR-H** | AR \+ Flow | 1.9B | **1.65** | **335.5** | High |

**4\. Unified Multimodal Models: The "Any-to-Any" Era**

The resurgence of efficient AR in vision has paved the way for **Unified Multimodal Models**—architectures that do not merely "glue" a vision encoder to a text decoder (Late Fusion) but process all modalities as a single, interleaved stream of tokens (Early Fusion). This represents the structural unification of AI, moving towards "Any-to-Any" generation.

### **4.1 Early Fusion vs. Late Fusion**

Historically, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like Flamingo or LLaVA utilized **Late Fusion**. They employed a frozen vision encoder (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) to extract features, which were then projected into the LLM's embedding space via an adapter (e.g., Q-Former). While effective for *understanding* (VQA), this architecture is fundamentally asymmetrical: the model can "read" images but cannot "write" them natively; it relies on a separate diffusion model for generation.

**Early Fusion**, exemplified by **Chameleon** and **Llama 4**, fundamentally alters this. Images are tokenized (via VQ/FSQ) into discrete IDs that inhabit the same vocabulary space as text tokens.

* **Input Sequence:** "Design a logo"...  
* **Bidirectional Reasoning:** The model can attend to text tokens to generate image tokens, or attend to image tokens to generate text tokens, all within the same autoregressive loop. This enables true interleaved generation (e.g., creating a textbook with inline diagrams generated contextually).19

### **4.2 Llama 4: The "Herd" Architecture**

Llama 4 (released/previewed in 2025\) represents the industrial scaling of early fusion. It is described as "**natively multimodal**," meaning it was trained from scratch on interleaved text, image, and video data.

#### **4.2.1 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Context**

To manage the computational cost of processing dense visual data alongside text, Llama 4 utilizes a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture (specifically the "Maverick" variant). This allows the model to have a massive parameter count (e.g., 400B) while only activating a fraction (e.g., 17B) per token, maintaining inference efficiency.

* **10 Million Token Context:** A critical innovation in Llama 4 is the support for a **10 million token context window**. This is enabled by **Ring Attention** (also known as Context Parallelism), which shards the sequence across multiple GPUs in a ring topology to parallelize the attention calculation.  
* **I-ROPE:** To handle positional embeddings at this scale, Llama 4 introduces **Infinity Rotary Positional Embeddings (I-ROPE)**. It was discovered that traditional RoPE struggles with generalization at extreme lengths. I-ROPE interleaves layers with RoPE and layers with *no* positional embeddings (NoPE), forcing the model to rely on relative semantic positions, which generalizes better to infinite sequences.22

### **4.3 Chameleon: Stabilizing Mixed-Modal Training**

Meta's **Chameleon** pioneered the techniques required to stabilize the training of these early-fusion models. A major challenge is the entropy mismatch: text is low-entropy (sparse probability mass), while visual tokens are high-entropy (dense probability mass). When these compete in the same softmax layer, it leads to **logit drift**, where the norms of the image tokens dominate, causing the text generation capabilities to collapse.

* **QK-Norm:** Chameleon introduced Query-Key Normalization, applying LayerNorm to the ![][image10] and ![][image5] vectors *before* the attention dot product.  
* **z-loss:** A regularization term was added to penalize large logit values (![][image42]), preventing the "competition" between modalities from exploding the gradients.  
* **Result:** A 34B parameter model that outperforms Llama-2 on text tasks while achieving state-of-the-art image captioning and competitive image generation, proving that a single set of weights can master disparate modalities.19

### **4.4 Unified-IO 2: Expanding the Modality Frontier**

**Unified-IO 2** pushes the definition of "multimodal" beyond text and vision. It tokenizes **Audio**, **Video**, **3D Point Clouds**, and **Robotic Actions** into a shared semantic space.

* **Any-to-Any Capabilities:** By treating a robotic arm's joint velocity or a sound wave's spectrogram as just another sequence of tokens, Unified-IO 2 can perform tasks like:  
  * *Audio-to-Image:* "Draw the sound of a breaking glass."  
  * *Image-to-Action:* "Generate the trajectory to pick up the red mug."  
* **Performance:** It achieves state-of-the-art results on the **GRIT** benchmark, demonstrating that the autoregressive transformer is a universal computer, capable of modeling any distribution that can be serialized.28

**5\. Temporal Autoregression: Video Generation Frameworks**

Video generation represents the frontier where the efficiency of AR frameworks is most critically tested. A few seconds of video contains millions of pixels, and the model must maintain **temporal consistency** (objects must not morph randomly) over hundreds of frames.

### **5.1 3D Tokenization and Causal Diffusion**

The primary enabler for AR video is extremely high compression. **MAGVIT-v2** treats time as a third spatial dimension (![][image43]), utilizing the **LFQ** mechanism described in Section 2.3 to compress video into a manageable sequence of tokens. This allows LLMs to model video dynamics effectively.7

However, pure AR video models (like VideoGPT) often struggle with long-term consistency due to the quadratic cost of attention. Hybrid approaches have emerged to solve this:

* **Causal Video Diffusion (Ca2-VDM):** This framework introduces **unidirectional temporal attention** into the diffusion process. It allows the model to be autoregressive at the *clip* level—generating the next 16 frames conditioned on the previous 16\. By caching the Key/Value states of the past frames (similar to an LLM KV-cache), Ca2-VDM can generate infinitely long videos without memory explosion, solving the "forgetting" problem of standard diffusion.31

### **5.2 FlowAR for Video: Global Planning**

**FlowAR** extends its next-scale paradigm to the temporal domain. Instead of predicting the next *frame*, it predicts the next *scale* of the entire video volume.

* **Mechanism:** The model first generates a low-resolution, low-framerate "skeleton" of the video (![][image44]). This establishes the global motion trajectory and scene composition.  
* **Refinement:** Subsequent scales fill in the temporal gaps (frame interpolation) and spatial details (super-resolution). This hierarchical approach ensures temporal consistency because the motion is planned globally at the coarse stage, preventing the "morphing" artifacts common in frame-by-frame generation.34

### **5.3 Streaming Inference: T2V-Turbo**

For real-time applications, the latency of generating a full video is unacceptable. **T2V-Turbo** integrates a **Consistency Model**—a distilled diffusion model capable of generating high-quality outputs in 4-8 steps—with an autoregressive stream.

* **Streaming Architecture:** The model generates a "chunk" of video (e.g., 8 frames) and passes the last frame as the condition for the next chunk.  
* **Performance:** T2V-Turbo achieves a **Total Score of 85.13** on the **VBench** benchmark, surpassing proprietary systems like Gen-3 in specific metrics. Crucially, it enables **streaming inference at \~10 FPS** on a single GPU, making real-time interactive video generation feasible for the first time.33

## ---

**6\. Autoregressive Reasoning Frameworks: The Cognitive Layer**

Perhaps the most transformative development in the 2024-2025 period is the intersection of **Reasoning** and **Generation**. In the text domain, LLMs have evolved from "System 1" (rapid, intuitive) to "System 2" (slow, deliberative) thinkers via **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**. This paradigm is now being ported to visual generation, transforming models from "stochastic artists" into "reasoning engines."

### **6.1 System 2 in Vision: CoT and ToT**

The application of reasoning frameworks to vision involves inserting a "thinking" stage before the "generating" stage.

* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Before generating an image, the model generates a textual or structural plan.  
  * *Prompt:* "A cat sitting on a TV."  
  * *CoT Generation:* "First, I need to locate the TV. It should be a boxy shape in the center. Second, I will place a cat on top. The cat should be in a sitting pose, tail curled..."  
  * *Image Generation:* The model generates visual tokens conditioned on this explicit plan, leading to significantly higher prompt adherence.  
* **Tree-of-Thought (ToT):** For complex tasks (e.g., "Generate a storyboard for a mystery scene"), the model explores a tree of possibilities at inference time.  
  * *Branch 1:* "The detective finds a gun." \-\> *Verifier:* "Too cliché." \-\> Prune.  
  * *Branch 2:* "The detective finds a cryptic note." \-\> *Verifier:* "Good." \-\> Continue. This explicit search allows the model to self-correct logic errors before committing to pixels.37

### **6.2 Process Reward Models (PRM) vs. Outcome Reward Models (ORM)**

The engine of System 2 reasoning is the **Verifier**—a model trained to judge the quality of generation. The industry is shifting from **Outcome Supervision** (judging the final result) to **Process Supervision** (judging the reasoning steps).

* **Outcome Reward Models (ORM):** Evaluate the final image/video. Used in "Best-of-N" sampling (generate 100 images, pick the best). This is computationally inefficient and does not correct the model's logic.  
* **Process Reward Models (PRM):** Evaluate *each step* of the generation. In a VAR model, a PRM can score the ![][image30] token map. If the coarse composition is flawed, the PRM halts generation immediately, saving compute.  
  * **ThinkPRM:** A recent framework where the verifier generates a "thinking" sequence to justify its score ("I am giving this step a low score because the spatial layout contradicts the prompt 'cat on TV'"). ThinkPRM outperforms simple scoring models on reasoning benchmarks using only 1% of the training data.40  
  * **PARM (Potential Assessment Reward Model):** Addressing a specific flaw in visual PRMs (where early autoregressive steps are too blurry to judge), PARM is trained to estimate the *potential* of a blurry state to resolve into a high-quality image. This lookahead capability boosts performance on the **GenEval** benchmark by **24%**.43

### **6.3 Chain-of-Visual-Thought (CoVT)**

**Chain-of-Visual-Thought** represents the "native" version of CoT for vision. Instead of reasoning in text, the model reasons in **continuous visual tokens**.

* **Visual Thoughts:** These are latent representations that encode concepts like "depth," "surface normals," or "object mask" in a compressed format.  
* **Mechanism:** The VLM generates a sequence of "Visual Thought" tokens (e.g., a latent representation of the scene layout) before generating the final image tokens. These thoughts act as a bridge, grounding the high-level semantic plan in low-level perceptual constraints.  
* **Impact:** CoVT improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks by allowing the model to "visualize" the structure (e.g., occlusion relationships) before committing to pixels, similar to how a human artist sketches a wireframe before painting.44

**7\. Inference-Time Scaling: The "System 2" Advantage**

The convergence of Autoregressive architectures and Reasoning frameworks unlocks **Inference-Time Scaling**—the ability to improve model performance by increasing compute at the *generation* phase (test time) rather than the *training* phase.

### **7.1 The Search Advantage of AR over Diffusion**

Diffusion models operate in a continuous space, making "search" (finding the optimal path) difficult. Standard diffusion sampling is essentially a "random walk" down the energy gradient; one cannot easily "backtrack" and try a different path without restarting.

Autoregressive models, being discrete, inherently form a search tree. At each step, the model chooses from a vocabulary of tokens. This allows for the application of classic search algorithms:

* **Beam Search:** Instead of greedily picking the most likely token, the model maintains ![][image5] active hypotheses (beams).  
* **Guided Search:** A Verifier (PRM) scores the beams. If a beam starts generating a forbidden object or violates the prompt, it is pruned immediately.

### **7.2 Empirical Evidence: Beating Diffusion with Search**

A landmark 2025 study demonstrated the power of this approach. A **2B parameter Autoregressive model** using **Beam Search** outperformed a **12B parameter Diffusion model** (FLUX.1) that used random sampling.

* **Mechanism:** The discrete token space allowed the AR model to explore multiple structural hypotheses at the coarse scale. The verifier pruned the "bad" structures early.  
* **Conclusion:** This result shatters the assumption that model parameter count is the sole determinant of quality. **Architecture \+ Search \> Scale**. It suggests that the future of high-fidelity generation lies not just in bigger models, but in models that can "think" and "search" harder during inference.47

### **7.3 RULER-Bench and Physical Reasoning**

The **RULER-Bench** evaluates the reasoning capabilities of video models (e.g., consistency, causality, physics). It finds that while diffusion models have high visual fidelity, they often fail at "rule-based reasoning" (e.g., object permanence: a ball rolling behind a box must reappear). Autoregressive models, especially those equipped with CoT or Beam Search, show significantly higher "Rule Coherence," suggesting that AR is the superior architecture for "smart" video generation that adheres to physical laws.50

**8\. Conclusion: The Unified Autoregressive Future**

The era of fragmenting Artificial Intelligence into "Language Models" (Autoregressive) and "Vision Models" (Diffusion) is drawing to a close. The developments of 2024-2025 indicate a decisive shift toward **Unified Autoregressive Intelligence**.

By solving the **tokenization bottleneck** with Lookup-Free Quantization (LFQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), researchers have given transformers a high-fidelity visual vocabulary. By reinventing the **sequence order** with Next-Scale Prediction (VAR/FlexVAR), they have unlocked the efficiency required to scale these models to billions of parameters. And by integrating **Autoregressive Reasoning** (CoT, PRM, Search), they have endowed these models with the ability to plan, verify, and reason.

The evidence is clear: Visual Autoregressive models now follow the same **Scaling Laws** as LLMs, offer **Inference-Time Scaling** capabilities that Diffusion lacks, and enable **Any-to-Any** multimodal generation within a single architecture. As we move into the era of Llama 4 and beyond, the distinction between text and image generation will dissolve, replaced by a singular framework where every modality is just another language to be modeled, reasoned over, and generated. The "next token" is no longer just a word; it is a pixel, a sound, an action, and a thought.
