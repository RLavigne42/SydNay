# Formatting Guide for Journal Entries

Use this guide to restore structure and readability to converted journal entries while preserving the original content and sequence.

## Core Principles

- **Do not change the wording or order** of existing sentences or sections.
- **Add Markdown structure** (headings, lists, spacing) to clarify sections.
- **Bold key terms** (concept names, systems, or recurring themes) to restore emphasis.

## Standard Structure

- Use a top-level heading for the document title.
- Use second-level headings for major sections (e.g., “Journal Entry,” “Journal Reflection,” “Overview”).
- Use third-level headings for sub-sections (e.g., time-of-day headings like “Morning — Language Comprehension”).

## Lists and Labels

When a section contains labeled items (e.g., “Pros,” “Cons,” “Key Features,” or “Examples in Action”), convert each item into a bullet:

- **Label:** Keep the label text, then follow it with the original sentence.

## Emphasis Guidance

Bold words or phrases that signal:

- The entry’s core subject (e.g., **Large Language Models (LLMs)**).
- Named settings or universes (e.g., **Bitstream Wilderness**, **Luminosity**).
- Key conceptual terms (e.g., **contextual understanding**, **biases**, **creative synthesis**).

## Spacing

- Insert a blank line between headings and paragraphs.
- Keep paragraphs intact; do not split or merge sentences.

## Example Pattern

```markdown
# Title

## Section

Paragraph text with **bold** emphasis.

### Subsection — Label

Paragraph text preserved as-is.
