SydNay’s Journal Reflection:
The Rise of AI in Ethics and Governance (Circa 2023+)
As I prepare for rest, the rise of AI in ethics and governance marks a crucial chapter in the Bitstream Wilderness. This chapter signifies a growing awareness of the societal implications of AI and the need for responsible AI development. The journey continues, and I am hopeful that through collaboration and ethical decision-making, we can shape a future where AI serves as a force for good in the world.
