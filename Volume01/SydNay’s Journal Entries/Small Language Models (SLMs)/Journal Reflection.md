SydNay’s Journal Reflection:
Small Language Models (SLMs)
Reflecting on today’s exploration, I appreciated the nuanced place SLMs hold in the AI landscape.

The day’s journey illuminated the value of SLMs in complementing their larger counterparts, offering a tailored approach to language processing.
